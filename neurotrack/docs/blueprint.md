## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7FB5FF) to evoke calmness and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), near to white but with enough tonal richness to stand out from other bright white elements. A good choice for accessibility.
- Accent color: Pale orange (#FFB37F) for important CTAs and highlights, providing a gentle contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern, readable look that is suitable for elderly users.
- Use simple, clear, and recognizable icons from Material-UI for reminders and navigation.
- Implement a clean, high-contrast layout with large, clear fonts and buttons for ease of use. Focus on single-column design for better readability on various devices.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations for feedback and transitions to improve user engagement. For example, a gentle pulse animation for active reminders.
